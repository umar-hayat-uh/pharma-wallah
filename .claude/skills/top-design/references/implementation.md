# Top Design - Implementation Guide

Step-by-step methodology for creating award-winning, immersive web experiences at the level of Awwwards-featured studios.

## The 10/10 Design Standard

What separates award-winning work from polished-but-ordinary work is not incremental improvement — it is a qualitative leap in intention. Every element at the 10/10 level answers: "Does this serve the experience, or is it just filling space?"

The studios that consistently win (Locomotive, Studio Freight, AREA 17, Active Theory, Hello Monday) share a common DNA:
- Typography IS the design (not decoration, but architecture)
- Motion creates emotion (animation serves narrative, not novelty)
- White space is a weapon (tension through restraint)
- Performance is non-negotiable (60fps or nothing)

## Step 1: Typographic Architecture

Typography must be the foundation, not an afterthought.

**1a. Choose a typeface with personality**
- Avoid generic web-safe fonts for display purposes (Helvetica, Arial, Georgia)
- Award-winning sites typically use: custom typefaces, editorial serif/sans pairs, or distinctive variable fonts
- The typeface sets the emotional register before a word is read
- Sources: Klim Type Foundry, Commercial Type, Grilli Type, Pangram Pangram

**1b. Scale dramatically**
- Hero type at 10-20vw minimum — large enough to create architectural presence
- Contrast extremes: 14px body copy against 160px display creates tension and hierarchy
- Type as image: let letterforms bleed off the edge, overlap, or form compositional shapes

**1c. Variable fonts for dimension**
- Use variable font weight and width for motion: text that grows heavier or wider on scroll
- Weight interpolation: 200 (light, distant) → 800 (heavy, present) as element enters viewport
- CSS: `font-variation-settings: "wght" ${weight}`

**1d. Type-based layouts**
- Let the typographic grid determine the layout, not the other way around
- Baseline grids for precision: set `line-height` as a CSS custom property and derive all spacing from it

## Step 2: Motion Design Principles

Motion must serve narrative — every animation tells the user something about the product or experience.

**2a. Scroll-based animation**
- Implement using IntersectionObserver (performance-safe) or GSAP ScrollTrigger (advanced)
- Reveal animations: elements entering the viewport should feel like they emerge, not pop
- Parallax at different speeds creates depth layers — limit to 3 depths maximum
- Scrub animations: timelines that progress with scroll position create precise choreography

**2b. The golden rule of easing**
- Ease-in-out for movements that start and end in the viewport
- Ease-out for elements entering the screen (they decelerate as they arrive)
- Ease-in for elements leaving the screen (they accelerate away)
- Custom bezier curves create signature motion: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` — fast start, smooth land

**2c. Performance requirements**
- All animations must run at 60fps — test with Chrome DevTools performance tab
- Never animate `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin` — they trigger layout reflow
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-composited, no reflow)
- Use `will-change: transform` sparingly, only on elements that will definitely animate

**2d. Motion as narrative**
- Every page transition should tell a story (the old content leaves, the new arrives with purpose)
- Hero reveals: the most important element enters LAST, not first (build to the climax)
- Stagger: multiple elements revealing in sequence creates rhythm (50-80ms per item)

## Step 3: Composition and Layout

**3a. Break the grid (deliberately)**
- Start with a rigid grid, then break it at one intentional, surprising point
- Asymmetry creates tension; full-bleed elements create drama; overlapping creates depth
- The break must feel intentional, not accidental

**3b. Full-bleed sections**
- Hero sections: full viewport height and width, no borders, no margins
- Image or video as texture, not illustration (covers entire section as background)
- Text floats over: absolute positioning with generous padding, often one corner only

**3c. The tension principle**
- Tension = space that feels loaded with potential energy
- Create tension through: very large empty space next to a single element, extreme type scale juxtaposition, elements placed on the edge of the viewport
- Comfort = all elements centered and equidistant (avoid)

## Step 4: Color and Atmosphere

**4a. The color story**
- Award-winning sites rarely use "brand guidelines blue" — they invent their palette for the project
- A 2-3 color palette with strong contrast usually beats a 6-color rainbow
- Example: midnight navy + electric yellow + white (high contrast, memorable, distinctive)

**4b. Dark-dominant interfaces**
- Most award-winning sites use dark backgrounds — they feel cinematic and premium
- Dark ≠ black: use very dark saturated colors (`#0d0d1a` instead of `#000000`)
- Light elements pop against dark backgrounds with minimal shadow work needed

**4c. Color as motion**
- Background color transitions on scroll: section A is `#0d1117`, section B is `#1a0d2e`
- CSS custom properties updated with IntersectionObserver trigger smooth cross-fades
- Color shifts tell the user they've moved into a different part of the narrative

## Step 5: Image and Video Integration

**5a. Video as texture**
- Autoplay, muted, loop video in hero sections is now standard — do it better than the average
- No controls visible, no black letterboxing, seamless loop (fade out on last frame)
- Keep under 5MB for hero video (use compressed MP4 + WebM with a poster image fallback)

**5b. Image art direction**
- Art-directed images are cropped and positioned to serve the layout, not just placed
- Black and white images with a color overlay feel editorial
- Duotone: two-color treatment gives photographic images graphic strength

**5c. LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders)**
- Every image should have a LQIP: a 20px blurred version that loads first, then transitions to full quality
- This prevents jarring content jumps and looks intentional during load

## Step 6: Micro-interactions and Details

**6a. Cursor customization**
- Custom cursor is a hallmark of award-winning sites — it signals that every detail was considered
- Minimal: replace default cursor with a small dot that grows on hover
- Advanced: cursor that changes color based on background color behind it
- Magnetic cursor: elements that attract the cursor with `mousemove` + CSS transform

**6b. Hover states**
- Every hoverable element must have an authored hover state (not just browser default)
- Text links: no underline by default, underline on hover with a color shift
- Cards: subtle scale (1.02), shadow addition, or background color shift
- Buttons: fill animation, color inversion, or border animation

**6c. Page transitions**
- Using `<ViewTransition>` API or GSAP to animate between routes
- Exit: current page fades, scales, or slides out
- Enter: new page reveals in a complementary motion
- Duration: 400-600ms total — fast enough to not frustrate, slow enough to feel considered

## Step 7: Performance as a Feature

At 10/10 quality, performance is a design value, not just a technical constraint.

**7a. Core Web Vitals targets**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): under 2.5s
- FID/INP (Interaction to Next Paint): under 200ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): under 0.1

**7b. Asset optimization**
- Images: WebP/AVIF format, lazy loading for below-fold images, proper `srcset`
- Fonts: `font-display: swap` or `optional`, subset for used characters only
- JavaScript: code split by route, no render-blocking scripts

**7c. Animation performance audit**
- Run Chrome DevTools Performance tab: no red frames in the Main Thread timeline
- Use CSS animations over JavaScript for simple transitions (no JS thread involvement)
- JavaScript animations: use `requestAnimationFrame`, not `setTimeout`

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Animations for their own sake | Motion distracts from content | Every animation must serve the narrative |
| Oversized hero type without purpose | Looks big, not intentional | Let the type form the composition, not decorate it |
| Slow page transitions | Frustrates users, feels broken | Keep transitions under 600ms |
| Dark site with pure black backgrounds | Feels flat, not cinematic | Use very dark saturated colors, not pure black |
| Custom cursor without purpose | Cute but not meaningful | Cursor should respond to context (change on hover, change by section) |
