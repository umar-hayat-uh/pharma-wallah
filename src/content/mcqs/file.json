    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic antagonist used in hypertension and angina. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and myocardial contractility by blocking catecholamine effects. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, and Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic.",
